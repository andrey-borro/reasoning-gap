Solving these problems requires understanding the relationships between the growth factor, the number of time intervals, and the total time. Here's a general strategy to tackle such problems, which you can apply to various scenarios with different numbers, settings, or even algebraic variables.\n\n---\n\n### **General Strategy:**\n\n1. **Identify the Key Variables:**\n   - **Growth Factor (G):** The factor by which the quantity multiplies each time interval (e.g., doubles, triples).\n   - **Time per Interval (T_i):** The duration of each time interval.\n   - **Total Time (T_total):** The total time taken for the quantity to reach a specific level.\n   - **Number of Intervals (N):** The total number of intervals over the total time.\n   - **Initial Quantity (Q_0):** The starting amount (may not always be given explicitly).\n   - **Final Quantity (Q_final):** The amount after total time has elapsed.\n   - **Desired Fraction or Multiple (F):** The fraction or multiple of the final quantity you're interested in.\n\n2. **Establish the Relationship Between Time and Intervals:**\n   - Calculate the total number of intervals:\n     \\[\n     N = \\frac{T_{\\text{total}}}{T_i}\n     \\]\n   - This tells you how many times the growth occurs over the total time.\n\n3. **Use the Exponential Growth Formula:**\n   - The general formula for exponential growth is:\n     \\[\n     Q = Q_0 \\times G^n\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - \\( Q \\) is the quantity after \\( n \\) intervals.\n     - \\( n \\) is the number of intervals elapsed.\n\n4. **Set Up an Equation for the Desired Fraction:**\n   - When you're interested in the time when the quantity reaches a certain fraction \\( F \\) of \\( Q_{\\text{final}} \\), use:\n     \\[\n     F = \\frac{Q}{Q_{\\text{final}}} = \\frac{Q_0 \\times G^n}{Q_0 \\times G^N} = G^{n - N}\n     \\]\n     - Simplifies to:\n       \\[\n       F = G^{n - N}\n       \\]\n\n5. **Solve for the Number of Intervals (n):**\n   - Take the logarithm of both sides to solve for \\( n \\):\n     \\[\n     \\log(F) = (n - N) \\times \\log(G)\n     \\]\n     - Rearrange to find \\( n \\):\n       \\[\n       n = N + \\frac{\\log(F)}{\\log(G)}\n       \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Time at the Desired Fraction:**\n   - Multiply the number of intervals \\( n \\) by the time per interval \\( T_i \\):\n     \\[\n     T_{\\text{desired}} = n \\times T_i\n     \\]\n   - This gives you the total time elapsed to reach the fraction \\( F \\).\n\n7. **Find the Time After the Starting Point:**\n   - If the problem asks for the time after a specific starting event (e.g., after the switch was flicked), use \\( T_{\\text{desired}} \\) directly.\n   - If it asks for the time remaining until the final state, subtract \\( T_{\\text{desired}} \\) from \\( T_{\\text{total}} \\):\n     \\[\n     T_{\\text{remaining}} = T_{\\text{total}} - T_{\\text{desired}}\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Strategy to a Sample Problem:**\n\n**Sample Problem:**\n\n\"After a switch is flicked, the area of light shining within a room triples every \\( 5X \\) nanoseconds until it fills the room. If it takes \\( 7Y \\) nanoseconds for the room to fill, how many nanoseconds after the switch was flicked was the room at \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\) full?\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Key Variables:**\n   - Growth Factor (\\( G \\)): 3 (since the area triples)\n   - Time per Interval (\\( T_i \\)): \\( 5X \\) nanoseconds\n   - Total Time (\\( T_{\\text{total}} \\)): \\( 7Y \\) nanoseconds\n   - Desired Fraction (\\( F \\)): \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\)\n   - Number of Intervals (\\( N \\)): to be calculated\n   - Number of Intervals at Desired Fraction (\\( n \\)): to be found\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Intervals (N):**\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{T_{\\text{total}}}{T_i} = \\frac{7Y}{5X}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation for the Desired Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   F = G^{n - N}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{9} = 3^{n - N}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( n - N \\):**\n   - Recognize that \\( \\frac{1}{9} = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 = 3^{-2} \\):\n     \\[\n     3^{-2} = 3^{n - N}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     -2 = n - N\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n = N - 2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\( n \\):**\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{7Y}{5X} - 2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the Time at the Desired Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   T_{\\text{desired}} = n \\times T_i = \\left( \\frac{7Y}{5X} - 2 \\right) \\times 5X\n   \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     T_{\\text{desired}} = (7Y - 10X) \\ \\text{nanoseconds}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Answer:**\n   - The room was \\( (7Y - 10X) \\) nanoseconds after the switch was flicked when it was \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\) full.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points to Remember:**\n\n- **Exponential Growth:** When a quantity increases by a constant multiple over equal time intervals, it's exponential growth.\n- **Growth Factor (G):** The multiplier applied each interval (e.g., doubling means \\( G = 2 \\), tripling means \\( G = 3 \\)).\n- **Number of Intervals (N):** Total time divided by the time per interval.\n- **Using Logarithms:** Taking the logarithm allows you to solve for exponents (intervals) when dealing with exponential equations.\n- **Fraction of Final Amount:** You can express the desired quantity as a fraction or multiple of the final amount and relate it using exponents.\n- **Units Consistency:** Ensure all time units are consistent when performing calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Solving Similar Problems:**\n\n- **Understand the Scenario:** Carefully read the problem to identify the growth pattern and what is being asked.\n- **Express Variables Algebraically:** Don't be afraid to work with algebraic expressions (like \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\)) instead of numbers.\n- **Check Your Exponent Rules:** Remember that \\( G^{-k} = \\frac{1}{G^k} \\) and \\( \\log(G^k) = k \\log(G) \\).\n- **Simplify Logarithms When Possible:** Use known logarithmic identities to simplify your calculations.\n- **Verify Your Answer:** Plug your findings back into the original equation to ensure they make sense.\n\n---\n\nBy following this general strategy, you can confidently approach and solve a wide range of exponential growth problems, even when they involve different numbers, contexts, or variables."}
