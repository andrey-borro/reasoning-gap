To solve these problems, you can follow a generalized step-by-step approach:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understand the Growth Factor and Time Interval**\n\n- **Growth Factor**: Determine by what factor the quantity changes each time period. For example:\n  - If it **doubles**, the growth factor is **2**.\n  - If it **triples**, the growth factor is **3**.\n- **Time Per Growth Period**: Identify the time it takes for each growth event to occur (e.g., every 5 minutes, every 2 hours).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Determine the Total Number of Growth Periods**\n\n- **Total Time**: Know the total time it takes for the entire process.\n- **Calculate Number of Periods**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of Periods} = \\frac{\\text{Total Time}}{\\text{Time Per Growth Period}}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **3. Express Quantities Using Exponential Relationships**\n\n- The general formula for exponential growth is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Final Quantity} = \\text{Initial Quantity} \\times (\\text{Growth Factor})^{\\text{Number of Periods}}\n  \\]\n- This formula relates the initial and final quantities over the number of growth periods.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Set Up an Equation for the Specific Question**\n\n- **Find When a Fraction of the Final Quantity is Reached**:\n  - Let\u2019s say you need to find when the quantity reaches \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\) of its final amount.\n  - Set up the equation:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Desired Quantity} = \\frac{1}{k} \\times \\text{Final Quantity}\n    \\]\n- **Relate This Back to the Growth Formula**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Initial Quantity} \\times (\\text{Growth Factor})^{\\text{Number of Periods at Desired Time}} = \\frac{1}{k} \\times [\\text{Initial Quantity} \\times (\\text{Growth Factor})^{\\text{Total Number of Periods}}]\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **5. Simplify and Solve for the Unknown**\n\n- **Cancel Out Common Terms**:\n  - Divide both sides by the initial quantity to simplify.\n- **Use Properties of Exponents**:\n  \\[\n  (\\text{Growth Factor})^{\\text{Number of Periods at Desired Time}} = \\frac{1}{k} \\times (\\text{Growth Factor})^{\\text{Total Number of Periods}}\n  \\]\n- **Simplify the Equation**:\n  - Recognize that \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\) can be expressed as \\((\\text{Growth Factor})^{-\\text{m}}\\), where \\(m\\) is a number that satisfies the equation.\n- **Solve for the Number of Periods at Desired Time**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of Periods at Desired Time} = \\text{Total Number of Periods} - m\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **6. Convert Periods Back to Time**\n\n- **Calculate the Time Taken**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Time at Desired Quantity} = \\text{Number of Periods at Desired Time} \\times \\text{Time Per Growth Period}\n  \\]\n- **Alternatively**, find the time elapsed after the process started.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Answer the Question**\n\n- **State the Final Answer**:\n  - Provide the time when the quantity reaches the desired fraction.\n- **Verify**:\n  - Check that the answer makes sense within the context of the problem.\n\n---\n\n**Example Applied to a General Problem**:\n\n*Problem Statement*:\n\nAn initial quantity increases by a factor of **\\(G\\)** every **\\(T_p\\)** units of time. It takes a total of **\\(T_{total}\\)** time units for the quantity to reach its full amount. When did the quantity reach \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\) of its full amount?\n\n*Steps*:\n\n1. **Growth Factor**: \\(G\\)\n2. **Time Per Growth Period**: \\(T_p\\)\n3. **Total Number of Periods**:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{T_{total}}{T_p}\n   \\]\n4. **Desired Quantity Equation**:\n   \\[\n   (\\text{Initial Quantity}) \\times G^{n} = \\frac{1}{k} \\times [(\\text{Initial Quantity}) \\times G^{N}]\n   \\]\n5. **Simplify**:\n   - Cancel the initial quantity:\n     \\[\n     G^{n} = \\frac{1}{k} \\times G^{N}\n     \\]\n   - Express \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\) as \\(G^{-m}\\), where possible.\n6. **Relate Exponents**:\n   \\[\n   G^{n} = G^{N - m}\n   \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     n = N - m\n     \\]\n7. **Calculate Time at Desired Quantity**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time at Desired Quantity} = n \\times T_p = (N - m) \\times T_p = T_{total} - m \\times T_p\n   \\]\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - The quantity reaches \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\) of its full amount at time:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = T_{total} - m \\times T_p\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n**Key Concepts**:\n\n- **Exponential Growth**: When a quantity increases by the same factor over equal time intervals.\n- **Properties of Exponents**:\n  - \\(G^{a} \\times G^{b} = G^{a+b}\\)\n  - \\(G^{a} \\div G^{b} = G^{a-b}\\)\n  - \\(G^{-a} = \\frac{1}{G^{a}}\\)\n- **Solving for Variables**: Use logarithms if necessary when solving for exponents that are not integers.\n\n---\n\n**Tips for Similar Problems**:\n\n- **Identify Variables**: Clearly define all given quantities and variables.\n- **Keep Units Consistent**: Ensure time units and other measurements are consistent throughout the calculations.\n- **Check for Special Cases**: Sometimes, the desired fraction corresponds to a simple exponent (e.g., \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) corresponds to one growth period if the growth factor is 2).\n- **Understand the Context**: Make sure your answer makes sense in real-world terms related to the problem.\n\n---\n\nBy adapting this strategy to the specifics of any problem involving exponential growth or decay, you can systematically find the solution, even if the numbers, settings, or variables differ.", "model": "o1-preview-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1449, "input_tokens": 125, "reasoning_tokens": 2624}}
