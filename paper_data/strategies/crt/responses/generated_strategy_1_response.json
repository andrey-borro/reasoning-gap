These problems can vary in context\u2014ranging from biological populations to spreading light in a room\u2014but they share a common mathematical foundation. Here's a step-by-step guide to solving such problems, which can be applied regardless of the specific numbers or scenarios involved.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understand the Nature of Exponential Growth**\n\n- **Definition**: Exponential growth occurs when a quantity increases by the same factor in each equal time period.\n- **Growth Factor**: The multiplier that represents how much the quantity increases over one time interval. For example, \"triples\" means a growth factor of 3.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Identify the Key Variables**\n\n- **Growth Factor (\\( r \\))**: The factor by which the quantity increases each time period.\n- **Time Interval (\\( T \\))**: The duration of one period over which the growth factor applies.\n- **Total Time (\\( t_{\\text{total}} \\))**: The total elapsed time from the start until a certain event occurs (e.g., the room is filled).\n- **Desired Fraction of Completion (\\( F \\))**: The fraction of the total quantity you're interested in (e.g., \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\) full).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Set Up the Exponential Growth Equation**\n\nThe general form of the exponential growth equation is:\n\n\\[\nN = N_0 \\times r^{n}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) = the quantity at time \\( t \\)\n- \\( N_0 \\) = the initial quantity at time \\( t = 0 \\)\n- \\( r \\) = growth factor per time interval\n- \\( n \\) = number of time intervals elapsed (\\( n = \\frac{t}{T} \\))\n\n---\n\n### **4. Relate the Quantities Using Ratios**\n\nSince exponential growth is multiplicative, it's often useful to consider ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N}{N_{\\text{full}}} = \\left( \\frac{r^{n}}{r^{n_{\\text{full}}}} \\right) = r^{n - n_{\\text{full}}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N_{\\text{full}} \\) = total quantity when complete (e.g., full room)\n- \\( n_{\\text{full}} \\) = number of intervals needed to reach \\( N_{\\text{full}} \\)\n\n---\n\n### **5. Calculate the Number of Time Intervals**\n\n- **To Reach Full Completion**:\n\n  \\[\n  n_{\\text{full}} = \\frac{t_{\\text{total}}}{T}\n  \\]\n\n- **To Reach the Desired Fraction**:\n\n  You need to find \\( n \\) such that:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{N}{N_{\\text{full}}} = r^{n - n_{\\text{full}}}\n  \\]\n\n  Solving for \\( n \\):\n\n  \\[\n  n = n_{\\text{full}} + \\log_{r}\\left( \\frac{N}{N_{\\text{full}}} \\right)\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **6. Solve for the Desired Time**\n\n- **Calculate \\( n \\)** using the fraction \\( F \\):\n\n  \\[\n  n = n_{\\text{full}} + \\log_{r}(F)\n  \\]\n\n- **Find the Time (\\( t \\))**:\n\n  \\[\n  t = n \\times T\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **7. Example Application**\n\n**Problem Statement**:\nA quantity triples every \\( T \\) time units. It takes \\( t_{\\text{total}} \\) time units to reach full completion. After how much time was the quantity at \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\) of its full amount?\n\n**Steps**:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( n_{\\text{full}} \\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   n_{\\text{full}} = \\frac{t_{\\text{total}}}{T}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine \\( n \\) for \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\) full**:\n\n   Since \\( \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{3^2} = 3^{-2} \\), we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{N}{N_{\\text{full}}} = r^{n - n_{\\text{full}}} = 3^{n - n_{\\text{full}}} = 3^{-2}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n\n   \\[\n   n - n_{\\text{full}} = -2\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   n = n_{\\text{full}} - 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Time (\\( t \\))**:\n\n   \\[\n   t = n \\times T = (n_{\\text{full}} - 2) \\times T\n   \\]\n\n   Convert \\( n_{\\text{full}} \\) back to time:\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\left( \\frac{t_{\\text{total}}}{T} - 2 \\right) \\times T = t_{\\text{total}} - 2T\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **8. General Solution**\n\nThe time when the quantity is at a fraction \\( F \\) of its full amount is:\n\n\\[\nt = t_{\\text{total}} + T \\times \\log_{r}(F)\n\\]\n\n- **Note**: Since \\( \\log_{r}(F) \\) is negative when \\( F < 1 \\), this correctly subtracts time from \\( t_{\\text{total}} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **9. Tips for Solving Similar Problems**\n\n- **Identify the Growth Pattern**: Determine if the problem involves exponential growth or decay.\n- **Express Fractions as Powers of the Growth Factor**: This simplifies calculations using logarithms.\n- **Use Logarithms for Non-Integer Exponents**: When the exponent isn't a whole number, logarithms are essential.\n- **Check Units Consistency**: Ensure time units are consistent throughout the calculations.\n- **Interpret Negative Time Intervals**: A negative \\( \\log_{r}(F) \\) indicates looking back in time from a known point.\n\n---\n\n### **10. Practice with Variations**\n\nTry applying this strategy to different scenarios:\n\n- A bacteria culture doubles every 3 hours and reaches a population of \\( P \\) in 24 hours. When was the population at \\( \\frac{P}{8} \\)?\n- A radioactive substance decays to half its mass every 5 days. How long until it reaches \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) of its original mass?\n\n---\n\n**Remember**: The key to solving exponential growth problems is understanding how quantities scale over time and using logarithms to solve for variables in the exponents.
