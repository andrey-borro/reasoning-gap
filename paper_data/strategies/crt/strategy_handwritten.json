{"strategy": "\n**GENERAL STRATEGY**\n1. Find the proportion of the full amount that your target population is at. Sometimes this is given e.g. '1/25th', but sometimes you have to work it out e.g. '5 / 45 = 1/9th'\n\n2. Figure out how many time steps ago the target population occurred at. If the population is tripling, then 1/3rd happens one time step ago, 1/9th happens two, 1/27th happens three and so on.\n\n3. Give the final answer. It should be TIME_TO_FULL - TIME_STEPS * TIME_STEP_SIZE\n\nFor example, if you have: \"Population takes 12M days to reach full, tripling every 5N days, how long does it take to get to 1/9th of full\", then the final answer will be 12M - 2 * 5N = 12M - 10N. \n"}
