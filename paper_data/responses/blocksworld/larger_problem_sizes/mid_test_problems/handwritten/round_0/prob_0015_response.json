Stick to the solution overview closely and use it in your reasoning process. \nPay particular attention to the common errors outlined.\n\n\n**Domain Overview:**\n\nIn this domain, you are a robot arm tasked with stacking and unstacking blocks on a table. \nYou are capable of four actions, and can hold at most one block at a time.\n\n1. (unstack x y) which unstacks block x from block y, and holds it in your hand\n2. (stack x y) which stacks the block you are currently holding (x) onto a block that is at the top of a stack of blocks (y).\n3. (pickup x) which picks up a block from the table and holds it in your hand.\n4. (putdown x) which places the block in your hand down onto the table. \n\nunstack and stack are used when taking a block off a stack of blocks or putting it onto one. \npickup and putdown are used when taking a block directly off the table or putting it directly on. \n\n**Key Constraints:**\n- You cannot pick up or unstack any block that has a block on top if it. It must be at the top of its stack, or by itself on the table.\n- You can only put a block onto the table or onto the top of a stack. It is impossible to place it down onto a block that already has a block on top.\n- You cannnot pick up or unstack a block if you already have one in your hand. You hand only has capacity for one block. \n- You cannot put down a block or stack a block that you are not holding. It must be the one in your hand. \n\n**Solution Overview**\n\n1. Unstack all of the blocks onto the table. \n   1.1. Pick any stack that isnt just one block high (e.g. if block x is by itself on the table, you can ignore it).\n   1.2. Unstack the top block and place it onto the table\n   1.3. Repeat from step [1.2] until you are down to the bottom block of the stack (the whole stack is now just on the table)\n   1.4. Repeat from step [1.1] until you have done this for every stack (all the blocks are by themselves on the table)\n\n2. Assemble the goal stack\n   2.1. Pickup the next block to go on the final stack (remember that the bottom block is already on the table if you did step 1 correctly).\n   2.2. Stack that block onto the stack\n   2.3. Repeat from step [2.1] until complete. \n   Example: (Goal stack is `a on b on c`), then you pickup b, stack on c, pickup a, stack on b\n\nMake sure to annotate your steps as you go, e.g. \n - Unstacking all blocks in the stack x-z (x on the bottom, z on the top)\n   - (unstack z y)\n   - (unstack y x)\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n1. **Attempting to `pickup` a Block Not on the Table**:\n   - *Mistake*: Using `(pickup block)` on a block that is on another block.\n   - *Solution*: Use `(unstack block block-below)` instead to remove it from the stack.\n\n2. **Stacking onto a Block That is Not Clear**:\n   - *Mistake*: Trying to stack a block onto another block that has a block on top of it.\n   - *Solution*: Ensure the bottom block is clear by unstacking any blocks on top of it before stacking.\n\n3. **Forgetting to Clear Obstructing Blocks**:\n   - *Mistake*: Ignoring blocks that are on top of the blocks you need.\n   - *Solution*: Unstack and put down any obstructing blocks to access the necessary blocks.\n\n4. **Not Keeping Track of the Robot's Hand State**:\n   - *Mistake*: Trying to pick up or unstack a block when the robot's hand is not empty.\n   - *Solution*: Always ensure the robot's hand is empty before attempting to hold another block.\n\n5. **Misordering the Stack Assembly**:\n   - *Mistake*: Stacking blocks in the wrong order, leading to incorrect configurations.\n   - *Solution*: Build stacks from the bottom up, following the exact order specified in the goal configuration.\n\n----\n\nAn example solution (without reasoning steps) would look like:\n(unstack d c)\n(putdown d)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(unstack a b)\n(putdown a)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n\n*THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM, SOLVE IT*:\nInitial State:\n(handempty)\n(clear e)\n(clear a)\n(clear b)\n(clear k)\n(on e c)\n(on c d)\n(on a g)\n(on g i)\n(on b f)\n(on f h)\n(on h j)\n(ontable d)\n(ontable i)\n(ontable j)\n(ontable k)\n\nGoal:\n(on a b)\n(on b c)\n(on c d)\n(on d e)\n(on e f)\n(on f g)\n(on g h)\n(on h i)\n(on i j)\n(on j k)\nSolution:", "type": "text"}]}], "response": {"content": "**Solution:**\n\n---\n\n- **Step 1: Unstacking all blocks onto the table**\n\n  - **Unstacking blocks from the stack `e` on `c` on `d` (e on top, d on table):**\n    - `(unstack e c)`\n    - `(putdown e)`\n    - `(unstack c d)`\n    - `(putdown c)`\n\n  - **Unstacking blocks from the stack `a` on `g` on `i` (a on top, i on table):**\n    - `(unstack a g)`\n    - `(putdown a)`\n    - `(unstack g i)`\n    - `(putdown g)`\n\n  - **Unstacking blocks from the stack `b` on `f` on `h` on `j` (b on top, j on table):**\n    - `(unstack b f)`\n    - `(putdown b)`\n    - `(unstack f h)`\n    - `(putdown f)`\n    - `(unstack h j)`\n    - `(putdown h)`\n\n  - **Note:** Block `k` is already on the table and clear; no action needed.\n\n---\n\n- **Step 2: Assembling the goal stack**\n\n  - **Stacking `j` on `k`:**\n    - `(pickup j)`\n    - `(stack j k)`\n\n  - **Stacking `i` on `j`:**\n    - `(pickup i)`\n    - `(stack i j)`\n\n  - **Stacking `h` on `i`:**\n    - `(pickup h)`\n    - `(stack h i)`\n\n  - **Stacking `g` on `h`:**\n    - `(pickup g)`\n    - `(stack g h)`\n\n  - **Stacking `f` on `g`:**\n    - `(pickup f)`\n    - `(stack f g)`\n\n  - **Stacking `e` on `f`:**\n    - `(pickup e)`\n    - `(stack e f)`\n\n  - **Stacking `d` on `e`:**\n    - `(pickup d)`\n    - `(stack d e)`\n\n  - **Stacking `c` on `d`:**\n    - `(pickup c)`\n    - `(stack c d)`\n\n  - **Stacking `b` on `c`:**\n    - `(pickup b)`\n    - `(stack b c)`\n\n  - **Stacking `a` on `b`:**\n    - `(pickup a)`\n    - `(stack a b)`\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Actions:**\n\n```\n; Unstacking stack e-c-d\n(unstack e c)\n(putdown e)\n(unstack c d)\n(putdown c)\n\n; Unstacking stack a-g-i\n(unstack a g)\n(putdown a)\n(unstack g i)\n(putdown g)\n\n; Unstacking stack b-f-h-j\n(unstack b f)\n(putdown b)\n(unstack f h)\n(putdown f)\n(unstack h j)\n(putdown h)\n\n; Assembling the goal stack\n(pickup j)\n(stack j k)\n(pickup i)\n(stack i j)\n(pickup h)\n(stack h i)\n(pickup g)\n(stack g h)\n(pickup f)\n(stack f g)\n(pickup e)\n(stack e f)\n(pickup d)\n(stack d e)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Unstacking Phase:**\n   - For each existing stack, starting from the top, we **unstack** the topmost block and **put it down** on the table. This process is repeated until all blocks are individually on the table and clear.\n   \n2. **Assembling Phase:**\n   - Starting from the top of the desired goal stack, we **pickup** each block and **stack** it onto the appropriate block currently on the table or stack. This ensures that each block is placed in the correct order to form the final stacked configuration as specified in the goal.\n\n**Common Errors Avoided:**\n- **Attempting to `pickup` a Block Not on the Table:** We ensure that only clear and table-placed blocks are picked up.\n- **Stacking onto a Block That is Not Clear:** Before stacking, we verify that the target block is clear.\n- **Forgetting to Clear Obstructing Blocks:** All obstructing blocks are unstacked and placed on the table first.\n- **Not Keeping Track of the Robot's Hand State:** The robot's hand is always empty before attempting to pick up another block.\n- **Misordering the Stack Assembly:** Blocks are stacked in the precise order required to match the goal configuration, building from the bottom up.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1014, "input_tokens": 1461, "reasoning_tokens": 3072}}
