Stick to the solution overview closely and use it in your reasoning process. \nPay particular attention to the common errors outlined.\n\nDomain Overview:\n\nIn this domain, we work with a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on a table. The goal is to rearrange the blocks to match a specific configuration. You can manipulate the blocks one at a time using a robotic arm (the agent) that can hold only one block at a time.\n\nAvailable actions to manipulate the blocks:\n\n1. **Pickup (block)**: Pick up a clear block from the table when the agent's hand is empty.\n2. **Putdown (block)**: Place a block the agent is holding onto the table.\n3. **Unstack (top-block, bottom-block)**: Remove a clear top block from a stack when the agent's hand is empty.\n4. **Stack (top-block, bottom-block)**: Place a block the agent is holding onto a clear bottom block to form a stack.\n\nKey Constraints:\n\n- The agent can hold only one block at a time.\n- A block must be clear (no blocks on top of it) to be picked up, unstacked, or have another block stacked onto it.\n- The agent's hand must be empty to pick up or unstack a block.\n- To stack a block onto another, the block being stacked onto must be clear.\n\nSolution Overview:\n\nTo solve the problem, follow these step-by-step instructions:\n\n1. **Understand the Goal Configuration**:\n   - **Identify** each block and determine where it needs to be in the final arrangement.\n   - **Note** the desired stacking order from bottom to top as specified in the goal.\n\n2. **Plan the Stacking Sequence from Bottom to Top**:\n   - **List** the blocks in the order they need to be stacked, starting with the bottom block.\n   - **Ensure** you know which blocks need to be moved and which are already in the correct position.\n\n3. **Prepare the Bottom Block(s)**:\n   - For each bottom block in the desired stack:\n     - a. **Locate** the block.\n     - b. If the block is not on the table:\n        - **Unstack** it from any block below using the `unstack` action.\n        - **Put it down** on the table using the `putdown` action.\n     - c. **Make sure** the block is clear by removing any blocks on top:\n        - If there are blocks on top, **unstack** them and **put them down** on the table.\n\n4. **Stack Each Block in Order**:\n   - For each subsequent block in your stacking sequence:\n     - a. **Ensure the block to move is clear**:\n        - If there are blocks on top, **unstack** them and **put them down** on the table.\n     - b. **Ensure the target block (the one to stack onto) is clear**:\n        - If it is not clear, **unstack** any blocks on top and **put them down** on the table.\n     - c. **Pick up the block**:\n        - If the block is on the table and clear, use the `pickup` action.\n        - If the block is on another block and clear, use the `unstack` action.\n     - d. **Stack the block onto the target block** using the `stack` action.\n\n5. **Repeat Until All Blocks Are Stacked Correctly**:\n   - **Continue** stacking each block in order, following steps 4a to 4d for each one.\n   - **Verify** after each action that the blocks are in the correct intermediate configuration towards the goal.\n\n6. **Check That the Goal State Is Achieved**:\n   - **Compare** the current configuration of blocks with the goal configuration.\n   - **Confirm** that each block is in the correct position and order.\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n\n1. **Not Clearing Blocks Before Moving Them**:\n   - Always ensure a block is clear (no blocks on top) before attempting to pick it up or unstack it.\n\n2. **Forgetting to Clear the Target Block Before Stacking Onto It**:\n   - Make sure the block you want to stack onto is clear before stacking.\n\n3. **Not Emptying the Agent's Hand Before Picking Up a New Block**:\n   - Remember that the agent must have an empty hand to pick up or unstack a block.\n\n4. **Stacking Blocks in the Wrong Order**:\n   - Follow the planned stacking sequence strictly from bottom to top to avoid misplacement.\n\n5. **Ignoring Blocks Not Involved in the Final Stack**:\n   - Move unnecessary blocks out of the way by placing them on the table so they don't interfere with stacking.\n----\n\nAn example solution (without reasoning steps) would look like:\n(unstack d c)\n(putdown d)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(unstack a b)\n(putdown a)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n\n*THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM, SOLVE IT*:\nInitial State:\n(handempty)\n(clear k)\n(clear c)\n(clear j)\n(on k b)\n(on b g)\n(on g i)\n(on i f)\n(on f h)\n(on h e)\n(on e a)\n(on c d)\n(ontable a)\n(ontable d)\n(ontable j)\n\nGoal:\n(on a b)\n(on b c)\n(on c d)\n(on d e)\n(on e f)\n(on f g)\n(on g h)\n(on h i)\n(on i j)\n(on j k)\nSolution:", "type": "text"}]}], "response": {"content": "**Solution:**\n\nTo achieve the goal configuration from the given initial state, follow the sequence of actions below.
