The action `(unstack j c)` is indeed not executable in the given state because block `j` is **not clear**\u2014block `f` is on top of `j`.

This ensures that each block to be unstacked is clear before attempting the action.\n   \n2. **Building the Goal Stack:**\n   - **Pick up and stack** each block in the order required by the goal, starting from the bottom (`a` on `b`) and working upwards to `j` on `k`.\n   \n3. **Hand Empty Condition:**\n   - Each action maintains the `(handempty)` condition after completing the `putdown` or `stack` actions, ensuring that the robot arm is ready for the next action without holding any blocks.\n\nThis corrected sequence ensures that all preconditions for each action are satisfied before executing them, leading to the successful achievement of the goal state.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1071, "input_tokens": 829, "reasoning_tokens": 2816}}
