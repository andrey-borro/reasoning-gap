Below is a step-by-step PDDL solution that transforms the given initial state into the desired goal state. The solution consists of a sequence of actions using the provided operators.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **(unstack d b)**\n2. **(putdown d)**\n3. **(pickup a)**\n4. **(stack a b)**\n5. **(unstack h c)**\n6. **(putdown h)**\n7. **(unstack a b)**\n8. **(putdown a)**\n9. **(unstack b e)**\n10. **(stack b c)**\n11. **(pickup a)**\n12. **(stack a b)**\n13. **(unstack e i)**\n14. **(putdown e)**\n15. **(pickup c)**\n16. **(stack c d)**\n17. **(pickup e)**\n18. **(stack e f)**\n19. **(unstack i g)**\n20. **(putdown i)**\n21. **(pickup g)**\n22. **(stack g h)**\n23. **(pickup i)**\n24. **(stack i j)**\n25. **(pickup f)**\n26. **(stack f g)**\n27. **(pickup e)**\n28. **(stack e f)**\n29. **(pickup d)**\n30. **(stack d e)**\n31. **(pickup c)**\n32. **(stack c d)**\n33. **(pickup b)**\n34. **(stack b c)**\n35. **(pickup a)**\n36. **(stack a b)**\n37. **(pickup h)**\n38. **(stack h i)**\n\n**Explanation of Key Steps:**\n\n- **Clearing Blocks:** Actions like `(unstack ...)` and `(putdown ...)` are used to clear blocks that are blocking others needed for the goal configuration.\n  \n- **Stacking Blocks:** Once the necessary blocks are clear, `(stack ...)` actions place them onto their designated positions as per the goal.\n  \n- **Rearranging Sub-stacks:** Intermediate stacks are rearranged to build the final desired stack from the bottom up, ensuring that each block is placed correctly.\n\n**Final Configuration:**\n\nAfter executing all the above actions, the blocks will be arranged as follows:\n\n```\na on b\nb on c\nc on d\nd on e\ne on f\nf on g\ng on h\nh on i\ni on j\nj on table\n```\n\nThis satisfies all the goal conditions specified.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 564, "input_tokens": 449, "reasoning_tokens": 7808}}
