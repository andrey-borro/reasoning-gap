You're correct that the action `(unstack c g)` is not executable in the initial state because the block `c` is **not clear**\u2014it has block `j` on top of it.\n\nTo achieve the goal state, we need to **first clear all blocks stacked on top of `c`** before we can unstack `c` from `g`.

Start by removing `j` from `c`.\n   - Continue removing each block on top of `j` down to `k` to ensure `c` becomes clear.\n\n2. **Rearranging `b` and `h`:**\n   - Unstack `b` from `h` and then `h` from `e` to prepare for stacking `b` correctly.\n\n3. **Building the Goal Stack from the Top Down:**\n   - Begin stacking `a` on `b`, then `b` on `c`, and so on, following the goal state hierarchy until `j` is stacked on `k`.\n\nThis revised sequence ensures that all preconditions for each action are satisfied before execution, leading to the successful achievement of the goal state.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 2334, "input_tokens": 842, "reasoning_tokens": 4480}}
