You correctly identified that the action `(unstack i g)` is not executable because the block `i` is **not clear**\u2014block `c` is still on top of it.

For example, a block must be **clear** and the **hand must be empty** before it can be unstacked or stacked.\n\n3. **Maintaining Hand State:**\n   - After each action, the state of the **hand** (whether it's holding a block or empty) is appropriately updated to allow the next action to proceed.\n\n4. **Building the Goal Stack Incrementally:**\n   - The solution carefully rebuilds the desired stack from the bottom (`b`) up to the top (`a`), ensuring each block is placed correctly on top of its intended lower block.\n\nBy following this corrected sequence, all actions will be executable, and the goal state will be achieved successfully.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1262, "input_tokens": 767, "reasoning_tokens": 3008}}
