The action `(unstack h c)` was attempted while block `h` was not clear because block `a` was still on top of it. To correct this, we need to first ensure that `h` is clear by moving `a` off of it before attempting to unstack `h` from `c`.\n\nHere is the revised, executable solution:\n\n1. **(unstack j k)**\n2. **(putdown j)**\n3. **(unstack k i)**\n4. **(putdown k)**\n5. **(unstack f b)**\n6. **(putdown f)**\n7. **(unstack a h)**\n8. **(stack a b)**\n9. **(unstack a b)**\n10. **(stack b c)**\n11. **(stack a b)**\n12. **(unstack h c)**\n13. **(stack h i)**\n14. **(unstack i j)**\n15. **(stack i j)**\n16. **(unstack d g)**\n17. **(putdown d)**\n18. **(unstack c e)**\n19. **(stack c d)**\n20. **(pickup e)**\n21. **(stack e f)**\n22. **(pickup d)**\n23. **(stack d e)**\n24. **(pickup f)**\n25. **(stack f g)**\n26. **(pickup g)**\n27. **(stack g h)**\n28. **(pickup h)**\n29. **(stack h i)**\n30. **(pickup i)**\n31. **(stack i j)**\n32. **(pickup j)**\n33. **(stack j k)**\n34. **(pickup a)**\n35. **(stack a b)**\n\n### **Explanation of the Revised Steps:**\n\n1. **Unstack and Put Down Blocks to Clear Necessary Spaces:**\n   - **Steps 1-6:** Remove blocks `j`, `k`, and `f` from their current positions and place them on the table to clear `k` and `b`.\n   \n2. **Rearrange the Main Stack:**\n   - **Steps 7-11:** Move block `a` from `h` to `b`, then adjust `b` to be placed on `c` while keeping `a` on `b`. This ensures both `(on a b)` and `(on b c)` are satisfied.\n   \n3. **Clear Block `h` and Continue Stacking:**\n   - **Step 12:** Now that `a` is properly placed on `b`, `h` becomes clear and can be unstacked from `c`.\n   - **Steps 13-15:** Move `h` onto `i`, and then adjust `i` to be on `j`, ensuring the stacking order continues correctly.\n   \n4. **Handle Remaining Blocks:**\n   - **Steps 16-27:** Unstack and stack blocks `d`, `c`, `e`, `f`, and `g` to build the required sequence `(on c d)`, `(on d e)`, `(on e f)`, `(on f g)`, and `(on g h)`.\n   \n5. **Finalize the Stack Upwards:**\n   - **Steps 28-35:** Complete the stacking by positioning `h` on `i`, `i` on `j`, `j` on `k`, and finally ensuring `a` remains on `b` to satisfy the entire goal state.\n\n### **Final State:**\n\nAfter executing all the above actions, the blocks will be stacked in the following order, satisfying the goal state:\n\n```\na on b\nb on c\nc on d\nd on e\ne on f\nf on g\ng on h\nh on i\ni on j\nj on k\nk on table\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that each action is executable based on the preconditions and effects defined in the PDDL domain, and the final state meets all the specified goals.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 880, "input_tokens": 792, "reasoning_tokens": 11008}}
