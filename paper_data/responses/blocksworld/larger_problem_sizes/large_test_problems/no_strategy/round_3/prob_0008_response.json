In the PDDL domain, to perform `(pickup h)`, the preconditions `(clear h)`, `(ontable h)`, and `(handempty)` must all be true.\n\n- **Correction Applied:**  \n  - **Unstack `h` from `g`:**  \n    `(unstack h g)` ensures that `h` is removed from `g`, making `h` both clear and on the table.\n  \n  - **Pickup and Stack `h`:**  \n    After unstacking, `(pickup h)` is now executable because `h` is clear and on the table. Then, `(stack h i)` correctly places `h` onto `i` as per the goal state.\n\nThis corrected sequence ensures that all preconditions for each action are satisfied, allowing the plan to be executed successfully from start to finish.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1050, "input_tokens": 1059, "reasoning_tokens": 5056}}
