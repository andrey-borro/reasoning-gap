After each `stack` or `putdown` action, the hand should return to empty.\n\n- **Clearing Blocks:**  \n  Always ensure that the target block is clear before stacking another block onto it.\n\n- **On-Table Conditions:**  \n  When `putdown` or `pickup` actions are involved, maintain the `(ontable X)` conditions as required.\n\nThis corrected plan ensures that each action is executable based on the current state at each step, systematically leading from the initial state to the desired goal state.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1086, "input_tokens": 982, "reasoning_tokens": 10112}}
