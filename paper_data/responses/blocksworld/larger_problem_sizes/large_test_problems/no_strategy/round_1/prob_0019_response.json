This involves a series of `unstack` and `putdown` actions to clear each block step-by-step.\n\n- **Sequential Building:** Once all necessary blocks are clear, we then proceed to pick up each block in the order required by the goal and stack them accordingly.\n\n- **Avoiding Conflicts:** By clearing all obstructing blocks first, we ensure that each `unstack` and `stack` action adheres to the preconditions outlined in the PDDL domain.\n\nThis revised solution should be executable from the initial state and achieve the desired goal without encountering any precondition violations.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1325, "input_tokens": 1139, "reasoning_tokens": 4928}}
