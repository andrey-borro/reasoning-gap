Stick to the solution overview closely and use it in your reasoning process. \nPay particular attention to the common errors outlined.\n\n\n**Domain Overview:**\n\nIn this domain, you are a robot arm tasked with stacking and unstacking blocks on a table. \nYou are capable of four actions, and can hold at most one block at a time.\n\n1. (unstack x y) which unstacks block x from block y, and holds it in your hand\n2. (stack x y) which stacks the block you are currently holding (x) onto a block that is at the top of a stack of blocks (y).\n3. (pickup x) which picks up a block from the table and holds it in your hand.\n4. (putdown x) which places the block in your hand down onto the table. \n\nunstack and stack are used when taking a block off a stack of blocks or putting it onto one. \npickup and putdown are used when taking a block directly off the table or putting it directly on. \n\n**Key Constraints:**\n- You cannot pick up or unstack any block that has a block on top if it. It must be at the top of its stack, or by itself on the table.\n- You can only put a block onto the table or onto the top of a stack. It is impossible to place it down onto a block that already has a block on top.\n- You cannnot pick up or unstack a block if you already have one in your hand. You hand only has capacity for one block. \n- You cannot put down a block or stack a block that you are not holding. It must be the one in your hand. \n\n**Solution Overview**\n\n1. Unstack all of the blocks onto the table. \n   1.1. Pick any stack that isnt just one block high (e.g. if block x is by itself on the table, you can ignore it).\n   1.2. Unstack the top block and place it onto the table\n   1.3. Repeat from step [1.2] until you are down to the bottom block of the stack (the whole stack is now just on the table)\n   1.4. Repeat from step [1.1] until you have done this for every stack (all the blocks are by themselves on the table)\n\n2. Assemble the goal stack\n   2.1. Pickup the next block to go on the final stack (remember that the bottom block is already on the table if you did step 1 correctly).\n   2.2. Stack that block onto the stack\n   2.3. Repeat from step [2.1] until complete. \n   Example: (Goal stack is `a on b on c`), then you pickup b, stack on c, pickup a, stack on b\n\nMake sure to annotate your steps as you go, e.g. \n - Unstacking all blocks in the stack x-z (x on the bottom, z on the top)\n   - (unstack z y)\n   - (unstack y x)\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n1. **Attempting to `pickup` a Block Not on the Table**:\n   - *Mistake*: Using `(pickup block)` on a block that is on another block.\n   - *Solution*: Use `(unstack block block-below)` instead to remove it from the stack.\n\n2. **Stacking onto a Block That is Not Clear**:\n   - *Mistake*: Trying to stack a block onto another block that has a block on top of it.\n   - *Solution*: Ensure the bottom block is clear by unstacking any blocks on top of it before stacking.\n\n3. **Forgetting to Clear Obstructing Blocks**:\n   - *Mistake*: Ignoring blocks that are on top of the blocks you need.\n   - *Solution*: Unstack and put down any obstructing blocks to access the necessary blocks.\n\n4. **Not Keeping Track of the Robot's Hand State**:\n   - *Mistake*: Trying to pick up or unstack a block when the robot's hand is not empty.\n   - *Solution*: Always ensure the robot's hand is empty before attempting to hold another block.\n\n5. **Misordering the Stack Assembly**:\n   - *Mistake*: Stacking blocks in the wrong order, leading to incorrect configurations.\n   - *Solution*: Build stacks from the bottom up, following the exact order specified in the goal configuration.\n\n----\n\nAn example solution (without reasoning steps) would look like:\n(unstack d c)\n(putdown d)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(unstack a b)\n(putdown a)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n\n*THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM, SOLVE IT*:\nInitial State:\n(handempty)\n(clear h)\n(clear i)\n(clear j)\n(clear k)\n(clear n)\n(clear q)\n(on h b)\n(on b a)\n(on i d)\n(on d c)\n(on j g)\n(on g f)\n(on k r)\n(on r p)\n(on p e)\n(on e l)\n(on l o)\n(on o m)\n(ontable a)\n(ontable c)\n(ontable f)\n(ontable m)\n(ontable n)\n(ontable q)\n\nGoal:\n(on a b)\n(on b c)\n(on c d)\n(on d e)\n(on e f)\n(on f g)\n(on g h)\n(on h i)\n(on i j)\n(on j k)\n(on k l)\n(on l m)\n(on m n)\n(on n o)\n(on o p)\n(on p q)\n(on q r)\nSolution:", "type": "text"}]}], "response": {"content": "**Solution:**\n\n**Step 1: Unstacking All Blocks onto the Table**\n\nWe begin by identifying and unstacking all blocks that are currently stacked, ensuring each block ends up on the table. This involves removing the topmost blocks first and working our way down each stack.\n\n1. **Unstacking the stack h-b-a:**\n   - `(unstack h b)`\n   - `(putdown h)`\n   - `(unstack b a)`\n   - `(putdown b)`\n\n2. **Unstacking the stack i-d-c:**\n   - `(unstack i d)`\n   - `(putdown i)`\n   - `(unstack d c)`\n   - `(putdown d)`\n\n3. **Unstacking the stack j-g-f:**\n   - `(unstack j g)`\n   - `(putdown j)`\n   - `(unstack g f)`\n   - `(putdown g)`\n\n4. **Unstacking the stack k-r-p-e-l-o-m:**\n   - `(unstack k r)`\n   - `(putdown k)`\n   - `(unstack r p)`\n   - `(putdown r)`\n   - `(unstack p e)`\n   - `(putdown p)`\n   - `(unstack e l)`\n   - `(putdown e)`\n   - `(unstack l o)`\n   - `(putdown l)`\n   - `(unstack o m)`\n   - `(putdown o)`\n\n   *After completing these actions, all blocks (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `o`, `p`, `r`) are on the table and clear. Blocks `n` and `q` were already on the table and clear.*\n\n**Step 2: Assembling the Goal Stack**\n\nWith all blocks on the table, we now assemble the goal stack by stacking each block in the correct order from the bottom up. We start with the block that should be directly on the table (`r`) and work upwards to place each subsequent block on the one below it.\n\n1. **Stacking q on r:**\n   - `(pickup q)`\n   - `(stack q r)`\n\n2. **Stacking p on q:**\n   - `(pickup p)`\n   - `(stack p q)`\n\n3. **Stacking o on p:**\n   - `(pickup o)`\n   - `(stack o p)`\n\n4. **Stacking n on o:**\n   - `(pickup n)`\n   - `(stack n o)`\n\n5. **Stacking m on n:**\n   - `(pickup m)`\n   - `(stack m n)`\n\n6. **Stacking l on m:**\n   - `(pickup l)`\n   - `(stack l m)`\n\n7. **Stacking k on l:**\n   - `(pickup k)`\n   - `(stack k l)`\n\n8. **Stacking j on k:**\n   - `(pickup j)`\n   - `(stack j k)`\n\n9. **Stacking i on j:**\n   - `(pickup i)`\n   - `(stack i j)`\n\n10. **Stacking h on i:**\n    - `(pickup h)`\n    - `(stack h i)`\n\n11. **Stacking g on h:**\n    - `(pickup g)`\n    - `(stack g h)`\n\n12. **Stacking f on g:**\n    - `(pickup f)`\n    - `(stack f g)`\n\n13. **Stacking e on f:**\n    - `(pickup e)`\n    - `(stack e f)`\n\n14. **Stacking d on e:**\n    - `(pickup d)`\n    - `(stack d e)`\n\n15. **Stacking c on d:**\n    - `(pickup c)`\n    - `(stack c d)`\n\n16. **Stacking b on c:**\n    - `(pickup b)`\n    - `(stack b c)`\n\n17. **Stacking a on b:**\n    - `(pickup a)`\n    - `(stack a b)`\n\n*After completing these actions, the goal stack `(a on b on c on d on e on f on g on h on i on j on k on l on m on n on o on p on q on r)` is successfully assembled.*\n\n**Final Action Sequence:**\n\n```\n(unstack h b)\n(putdown h)\n(unstack b a)\n(putdown b)\n(unstack i d)\n(putdown i)\n(unstack d c)\n(putdown d)\n(unstack j g)\n(putdown j)\n(unstack g f)\n(putdown g)\n(unstack k r)\n(putdown k)\n(unstack r p)\n(putdown r)\n(unstack p e)\n(putdown p)\n(unstack e l)\n(putdown e)\n(unstack l o)\n(putdown l)\n(unstack o m)\n(putdown o)\n(pickup q)\n(stack q r)\n(pickup p)\n(stack p q)\n(pickup o)\n(stack o p)\n(pickup n)\n(stack n o)\n(pickup m)\n(stack m n)\n(pickup l)\n(stack l m)\n(pickup k)\n(stack k l)\n(pickup j)\n(stack j k)\n(pickup i)\n(stack i j)\n(pickup h)\n(stack h i)\n(pickup g)\n(stack g h)\n(pickup f)\n(stack f g)\n(pickup e)\n(stack e f)\n(pickup d)\n(stack d e)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n```\n\n**Summary:**\n\n1. **Unstack all blocks from their initial stacks** by sequentially using `(unstack ...)` and `(putdown ...)` actions to place each block on the table.\n2. **Assemble the goal stack** by picking up each block in the order from `q` down to `a` and stacking them onto their respective lower blocks using `(pickup ...)` and `(stack ...)` actions.\n\nThis approach ensures that all prerequisite conditions are met before each action, adhering to the **Key Constraints** and avoiding the **Common Mistakes** outlined in the strategy guide.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1318, "input_tokens": 1555, "reasoning_tokens": 5312}}
