Stick to the solution overview closely and use it in your reasoning process. \nPay particular attention to the common errors outlined.\n\n**Domain Overview:**\n\nIn this domain, we have a set of blocks that can be arranged either on a table or stacked on top of each other to form towers. A robotic arm manipulates the blocks to achieve a desired configuration specified in the goal state. The main actions the robot can perform are:\n\n- **Pickup**: Grasping a clear block from the table when the robot's hand is empty.\n- **Putdown**: Placing a held block onto the table, freeing the robot's hand.\n- **Unstack**: Removing a clear block from atop another block when the robot's hand is empty.\n- **Stack**: Placing a held block onto a clear block, creating or adding to a stack.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n- The robot can hold **only one block at a time**.\n- A block must be **clear** (no blocks on top) to be picked up or unstacked.\n- The robot's hand must be **empty** to pick up or unstack a block.\n- A block can only be stacked onto another block that is **clear**.\n- Only one block can be directly on top of another block.\n\n---\n\n**Solution Overview:**\n\nTo solve the problem, follow these step-by-step instructions:\n\n1. **Interpret the Goal State:**\n   - **a.** Examine the goal conditions to determine the desired final positions of all blocks.\n   - **b.** For each required stack, list the blocks from **bottom to top** to understand the stacking order.\n   - *Example:* If the goal is `(on a b)` and `(on b c)`, the stacking order is `c` (bottom), `b`, then `a` (top).\n\n2. **Assess the Initial State:**\n   - **a.** Identify the current positions of all blocks.\n   - **b.** Note any discrepancies between the initial state and the goal state.\n   - **c.** Determine which blocks need to be moved and which are already in the correct position.\n\n3. **Plan the Sequence of Actions:**\n   - **a.** Prioritize moving blocks that form the **base of the goal stacks** first.\n   - **b.** Plan to build stacks **from the bottom up**, placing the bottom blocks before the ones above.\n\n4. **Clear Any Obstructing Blocks:**\n   - **a.** For each block that needs to be moved but isn't clear:\n     - **i.** Use `unstack` to remove the block on top.\n     - **ii.** Use `putdown` to place the unneeded block onto the table.\n     - **iii.** Repeat until the target block is clear.\n   - **b.** Ensure that any blocks not part of the goal configuration are **placed out of the way** on the table.\n\n5. **Position the Bottom Blocks:**\n   - **a.** If a bottom block of a goal stack is not on the table:\n     - **i.** Clear any blocks on top using `unstack` and `putdown`.\n     - **ii.** Use `unstack` or `pickup` to hold the block.\n     - **iii.** Use `putdown` to place it on the table.\n   - **b.** Confirm that the bottom block is now on the table and clear.\n\n6. **Build the Goal Stacks:**\n   - **For each remaining block in the goal stack (from bottom to top):**\n     - **a.** **Prepare the Block to Stack:**\n       - **i.** If the block is not clear, clear it using `unstack` and `putdown`.\n       - **ii.** Ensure your hand is empty (`handempty` is true).\n       - **iii.** Use `pickup` (if on table) or `unstack` (if on another block) to hold the block.\n     - **b.** **Prepare the Target Block:**\n       - **i.** Ensure the block you will stack onto is clear.\n     - **c.** **Stack the Block:**\n       - **i.** Use `stack` to place the held block onto the target block.\n     - **d.** **Update the State:**\n       - **i.** Your hand is now empty.\n       - **ii.** The block you just stacked is no longer clear.\n       - **iii.** The block underneath is no longer clear if it wasn't already.\n\n7. **Repeat Until Goal State Is Achieved:**\n   - **a.** Continue the process for all blocks until they are in their goal positions.\n   - **b.** Verify that the final configuration matches the goal state.\n\n---\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n\n1. **Attempting to Move a Block That Is Not Clear:**\n   - *Avoidance:* Always check that a block is clear before trying to pick it up or unstack it.\n\n2. **Forgetting to Empty the Robot's Hand:**\n   - *Avoidance:* Ensure the robot's hand is empty (`handempty` is true) before attempting to pick up or unstack a block.\n\n3. **Stacking onto a Block That Is Not Clear:**\n   - *Avoidance:* Before stacking, confirm that the target block has no blocks on top of it.\n\n4. **Not Removing Obstructing Blocks:**\n   - *Avoidance:* Move any blocks that are on top of or blocking required blocks by unstacking and putting them down on the table.\n\n5. **Incorrect Stack Order:**\n   - *Avoidance:* Always build stacks from the **bottom up**, placing lower blocks before higher ones to maintain stability and correctness.\n\n---\n\nBy carefully following these steps and being mindful of common pitfalls, you can successfully rearrange the blocks to match any goal configuration within this domain.\n----\n\nAn example solution (without reasoning steps) would look like:\n(unstack d c)\n(putdown d)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(unstack a b)\n(putdown a)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n\n*THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM, SOLVE IT*:\nInitial State:\n(handempty)\n(clear d)\n(on d a)\n(on a b)\n(on b c)\n(on c e)\n(ontable e)\n\nGoal:\n(on a b)\n(on b c)\n(on c d)\n(on d e)\nSolution:", "type": "text"}]}], "response": {"content": "**Solution:**\n\nTo achieve the goal state `(on a b)`, `(on b c)`, `(on c d)`, `(on d e)`, follow the sequence of actions below.
