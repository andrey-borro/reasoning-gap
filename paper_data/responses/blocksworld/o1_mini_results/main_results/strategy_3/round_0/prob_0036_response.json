Stick to the solution overview closely and use it in your reasoning process. \nPay particular attention to the common errors outlined.\n\n**Domain Overview:**\n\nThe Blocks World domain consists of a set of blocks (e.g., a, b, c, d) that can be arranged on a table or stacked upon one another to form towers. A single robot arm manipulates the blocks using four primary actions:\n\n- **Pickup(block):** The robot picks up a block from the table. This action requires that the block is clear (no other block on top of it), is on the table, and the robot's hand is empty.\n  \n- **Putdown(block):** The robot places the block it is holding onto the table, freeing up its hand for other actions.\n  \n- **Unstack(top-block, bottom-block):** The robot removes the top block from a stack, separating it from the block beneath. This action requires that the top block is clear, the robot's hand is empty, and the top block is directly on the bottom block.\n  \n- **Stack(top-block, bottom-block):** The robot places the block it is holding onto another block. The bottom block must be clear for this action to be successful.\n\nThe objective in this domain is to rearrange the blocks to match a desired goal configuration by appropriately stacking and unstacking them.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n- The robot can hold only **one block at a time**.\n- A block must be **clear** (nothing on top of it) to be picked up or unstacked.\n- To **stack** a block onto another, the block being stacked upon must be **clear**.\n- The robot's hand must be **empty** to pick up or unstack a block.\n- Blocks can be either **on the table** or **on top of another block**.\n\n---\n\n**Solution Overview:**\n\nTo solve the problem, follow these step-by-step instructions:\n\n1. **Interpret the Goal Configuration:**\n\n   - Examine the goal state to determine the desired arrangement of the blocks.\n   - Identify the sequence of blocks in each stack from bottom to top.\n   - Note which blocks need to be moved and which are already in the correct position.\n\n2. **Plan the Assembly of Stacks from the Bottom Up:**\n\n   - Determine the lowest-level blocks (those that should be on the table) in the goal configuration.\n   - Plan to build each stack starting with the bottom block and adding each subsequent block on top.\n   - Ensure that blocks needed later are not buried under other blocks.\n\n3. **Clear Any Obstructing Blocks:**\n\n   - If a required block is not clear, make it clear by removing any blocks on top of it.\n   - Use the **Unstack** action to remove obstructing blocks:\n     - **Sub-instructions:**\n       - Unstack the top block from the required block.\n       - Put down the unstacked block on the table using **Putdown**.\n       - Repeat if there are multiple blocks to clear.\n\n4. **Position the Bottom Blocks on the Table:**\n\n   - Ensure that the bottom blocks of the goal stacks are on the table.\n   - If a bottom block is on top of another block, unstack it and put it on the table:\n     - **Sub-instructions:**\n       - Unstack the bottom block from any blocks beneath it.\n       - Put down the bottom block on the table using **Putdown**.\n\n5. **Build the Stacks Sequentially:**\n\n   - For each stack, starting from the bottom block:\n     - **Sub-instructions:**\n       - Ensure the bottom block is clear (nothing on top) and in the correct position.\n       - Pick up the block to be stacked next using **Pickup** (if on the table) or **Unstack** (if on another block).\n       - Stack the block onto the bottom block using **Stack**.\n       - Confirm that the newly placed block is correctly positioned.\n\n6. **Repeat Until the Goal Configuration is Achieved:**\n\n   - Continue the process for each block in the goal configuration.\n   - Verify after each action that blocks are correctly placed and that constraints are maintained.\n   - Adjust the plan if necessary to handle any unexpected obstructions.\n\n**Example Execution:**\n\n- To build a stack where block **c** is on block **d**, and block **d** is on the table:\n  - Ensure block **d** is on the table and clear.\n  - Pick up block **c** using **Pickup** (if on the table) or **Unstack** (if on another block).\n  - Stack block **c** onto block **d** using **Stack**.\n\n---\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n\n1. **Trying to Move a Block That Is Not Clear:**\n\n   - **Issue:** Attempting to pick up or unstack a block that has another block on top of it.\n   - **Solution:** Always check that the block is clear before moving it. Unstack any blocks above it first.\n\n2. **Failing to Empty the Hand Before Picking Up Another Block:**\n\n   - **Issue:** Attempting to pick up or unstack a block while holding another block.\n   - **Solution:** Use **Putdown** or **Stack** to free up the robot's hand before attempting to pick up a new block.\n\n3. **Stacking Blocks onto Non-Clear Blocks:**\n\n   - **Issue:** Attempting to stack a block onto another block that is not clear.\n   - **Solution:** Ensure the bottom block is clear before stacking onto it.\n\n4. **Building Stacks Out of Order:**\n\n   - **Issue:** Placing blocks in a sequence that requires disassembly later.\n   - **Solution:** Always build stacks from the bottom up according to the goal configuration.\n\n5. **Moving Blocks Unnecessarily:**\n\n   - **Issue:** Moving blocks that are already in their goal position.\n   - **Solution:** Identify blocks that are already correctly placed and avoid moving them unless necessary to clear other blocks.\n----\n\nAn example solution (without reasoning steps) would look like:\n(unstack d c)\n(putdown d)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(unstack a b)\n(putdown a)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n\n*THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM, SOLVE IT*:\nInitial State:\n(handempty)\n(clear a)\n(clear f)\n(on a c)\n(on c b)\n(on f d)\n(on d e)\n(ontable b)\n(ontable e)\n\nGoal:\n(on a b)\n(on b c)\n(on c d)\n(on d e)\n(on e f)\nSolution:", "type": "text"}]}], "response": {"content": "**Solution:**\n\nTo achieve the goal configuration, follow the sequence of actions below.
