This plan methodically unpacks the initial stack and rebuilds it in the desired order.\n\n1. **(unstack c b)**\n2. **(putdown c)**\n3. **(unstack b d)**\n4. **(putdown b)**\n5. **(unstack d f)**\n6. **(putdown d)**\n7. **(unstack f e)**\n8. **(putdown f)**\n9. **(unstack e a)**\n10. **(putdown e)**\n11. **(pickup e)**\n12. **(stack e f)**\n13. **(pickup d)**\n14. **(stack d e)**\n15. **(pickup c)**\n16. **(stack c d)**\n17. **(pickup b)**\n18. **(stack b c)**\n19. **(pickup a)**\n20. **(stack a b)**\n\n**Explanation of Steps:**\n\n1. **Unstacking and Separating Blocks:**\n   - **Steps 1-10:** These actions systematically remove each block from the initial stack and place them individually on the table. This clears the way to rebuild the stack in the desired order.\n   \n2. **Rebuilding the Stack in Goal Order:**\n   - **Steps 11-20:** After all blocks are on the table and clear, these actions pick up each block and stack them in the correct sequence to achieve the goal state:\n     - **(pickup e)** and **(stack e f)** places **e** on **f**.\n     - **(pickup d)** and **(stack d e)** places **d** on **e**.\n     - **(pickup c)** and **(stack c d)** places **c** on **d**.\n     - **(pickup b)** and **(stack b c)** places **b** on **c**.\n     - **(pickup a)** and **(stack a b)** places **a** on **b**.\n\nThis sequence results in the final configuration:\n- **a** on **b**\n- **b** on **c**\n- **c** on **d**\n- **d** on **e**\n- **e** on **f**\n- **f** on the table", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 512, "input_tokens": 391, "reasoning_tokens": 4224}}
