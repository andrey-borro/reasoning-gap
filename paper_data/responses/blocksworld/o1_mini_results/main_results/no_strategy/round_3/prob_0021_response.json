The error occurred because the action `(pickup c)` was attempted while block `b` was still on top of `c`, making `c` **not clear**. To successfully execute `(pickup c)`, block `c` must be clear, meaning no blocks are on top of it.\n\nHere's the **corrected solution** with the necessary additional steps to ensure that `c` becomes clear before attempting to pick it up:\n\n1. **Unstack `d` from `a`**\n   ```\n   (unstack d a)\n   ```\n2. **Put down `d` on the table**\n   ```\n   (putdown d)\n   ```\n3. **Unstack `a` from `e`**\n   ```\n   (unstack a e)\n   ```\n4. **Put down `a` on the table**\n   ```\n   (putdown a)\n   ```\n5. **Unstack `e` from `b`**\n   ```\n   (unstack e b)\n   ```\n6. **Put down `e` on the table**\n   ```\n   (putdown e)\n   ```\n7. **Pick up `a` from the table**\n   ```\n   (pickup a)\n   ```\n8. **Stack `a` on `b`**\n   ```\n   (stack a b)\n   ```\n9. **Unstack `b` from `c`** *(This step ensures that `c` becomes clear)*\n   ```\n   (unstack b c)\n   ```\n10. **Put down `b` on the table**\n    ```\n    (putdown b)\n    ```\n11. **Pick up `c` from the table**\n    ```\n    (pickup c)\n    ```\n12. **Stack `c` on `d`**\n    ```\n    (stack c d)\n    ```\n13. **Pick up `d` from `e`**\n    ```\n    (pickup d)\n    ```\n14. **Stack `d` on `e`**\n    ```\n    (stack d e)\n    ```\n15. **Pick up `b` from the table**\n    ```\n    (pickup b)\n    ```\n16. **Stack `b` on `c`**\n    ```\n    (stack b c)\n    ```\n17. **Pick up `a` from `b`**\n    ```\n    (pickup a)\n    ```\n18. **Stack `a` on `b`**\n    ```\n    (stack a b)\n    ```\n\n### **Final Solution Sequence:**\n```\n(unstack d a)\n(putdown d)\n(unstack a e)\n(putdown a)\n(unstack e b)\n(putdown e)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n(unstack b c)\n(putdown b)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(pickup d)\n(stack d e)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Corrected Steps:**\n\n1. **Initial Unstacking and Putting Down:**\n   - **Unstack `d` from `a`** and **put it down** to free up `a`.\n   - **Unstack `a` from `e`** and **put it down** to free up `e`.\n   - **Unstack `e` from `b`** and **put it down** to free up `b`.\n   \n2. **Rearranging Blocks:**\n   - **Pick up `a`** and **stack it on `b`**, establishing `(on a b)`.\n   \n3. **Clearing `c`:**\n   - **Unstack `b` from `c`** and **put down `b`** on the table, making `c` clear.\n   \n4. **Building the Desired Stack:**\n   - **Pick up `c`** and **stack it on `d`**, establishing `(on c d)`.\n   - **Pick up `d`** and **stack it on `e`**, establishing `(on d e)`.\n   \n5. **Finalizing the Goal:**\n   - **Pick up `b`** and **stack it back on `c`**, ensuring `(on b c)`.\n   - **Pick up `a`** and **stack it on `b`** again to finalize `(on a b)`.\n\n### **Final State Achieved:**\n- `(on a b)`\n- `(on b c)`\n- `(on c d)`\n- `(on d e)`\n- `(on e table)`\n- `(handempty)`\n- All other necessary predicates are satisfied.\n\nThis corrected sequence ensures that each action is **applicable** and **achievable**, leading to the desired goal state without encountering any execution errors.", "model": "o1-mini-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 994, "input_tokens": 567, "reasoning_tokens": 12608}}
