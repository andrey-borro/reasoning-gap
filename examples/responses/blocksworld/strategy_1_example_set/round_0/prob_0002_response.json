Stick to the solution overview closely and use it in your reasoning process. \nPay particular attention to the common errors outlined.\n\n**Domain Overview:**\n\nIn this domain, we are working with blocks (such as blocks A, B, C, D) that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on a table. The objective is to manipulate these blocks to achieve a specific arrangement (the goal state) starting from an initial setup (the initial state). A single robotic arm is used to move the blocks, one at a time, using the following actions:\n\n- **Pickup**: The robot can pick up a clear block from the table if its hand is empty.\n- **Putdown**: The robot can put down a block it is holding onto the table, freeing up its hand.\n- **Unstack**: The robot can unstack a clear block from on top of another block if its hand is empty.\n- **Stack**: The robot can stack a block it is holding onto a clear block.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n- The robot can hold only **one block at a time**.\n- A block must be **clear** (no block on top) to be moved.\n- The robot's hand must be **empty** to pick up or unstack a block.\n- To **stack** a block onto another, the target block must be **clear**.\n- Blocks can be placed on the **table** or stacked on other blocks.\n\n---\n\n**Solution Overview:**\n\nTo solve the problem, follow these step-by-step instructions:\n\n1. **Interpret the Goal Configuration:**\n   - **List the Goal Conditions**: Write down all the goal statements to understand where each block needs to be. For example:\n     - `(on A B)` means block A should be on block B.\n     - `(on B C)` means block B should be on block C.\n     - `(on C D)` means block C should be on block D.\n   - **Determine the Goal Stacks**: Identify the sequences of blocks that need to be stacked together.\n\n2. **Plan the Sequence of Moves:**\n   - **Identify the Order of Assembly**:\n     - Start with the **bottom blocks** of each stack and work upwards.\n     - Ensure that lower blocks are placed before stacking higher blocks onto them.\n     - For example, place block D first, then stack C on D, followed by B on C, and finally A on B.\n\n3. **Prepare Blocks for Movement:**\n   - **Ensure Blocks are Clear**:\n     - For each block that needs to be moved, check if it is **clear**.\n     - If a block has other blocks on top, **unstack** those blocks one at a time.\n       - Use `unstack` to remove the top block.\n       - Use `putdown` to place it on the table.\n     - Repeat until the target block is clear.\n\n4. **Move Blocks to Goal Positions:**\n   - **Place Bottom Blocks First**:\n     - If a bottom block (e.g., block D) is not in its goal position:\n       - **If it's buried**, unstack any blocks on top.\n       - **Move it to the table** if required.\n     - Ensure the bottom block is placed correctly.\n   - **Stack Upper Blocks Sequentially**:\n     - For each subsequent block (e.g., C, B, A):\n       - **Ensure the Target Block is Ready**:\n         - Verify that the block it needs to be stacked upon is **in position and clear**.\n       - **Pick Up or Unstack the Block**:\n         - If the block is on the table and clear, use `pickup`.\n         - If the block is on another block, use `unstack`.\n       - **Stack the Block onto the Target Block**:\n         - Use `stack` to place it onto the required block.\n     - **Example**:\n       - To stack block C onto block D:\n         - Ensure block D is in position and clear.\n         - If holding another block, use `putdown` to free the hand.\n         - Use `pickup` or `unstack` to get block C.\n         - Use `stack` to place block C onto block D.\n\n5. **Handle Temporarily Moved Blocks:**\n   - **Place Aside Unneeded Blocks**:\n     - Any blocks removed during unstacking that are not immediately needed should be placed on the table.\n   - **Keep Blocks Clear**:\n     - Ensure these blocks remain clear and do not interfere with upcoming moves.\n\n6. **Repeat Until Goal is Achieved:**\n   - **Continue the Process**:\n     - Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all blocks until every block is in its goal position.\n   - **Verify Goal Conditions**:\n     - Check that all goal statements are satisfied.\n\n---\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n\n1. **Not Emptying the Hand Before Picking Up a Block:**\n   - *Issue*: Trying to pick up or unstack a block while already holding another block.\n   - *Avoidance*: Always use `putdown` to place the held block on the table before picking up a new block.\n\n2. **Moving a Block That is Not Clear:**\n   - *Issue*: Attempting to pick up or unstack a block that has another block on top.\n   - *Avoidance*: Ensure the block is clear by unstacking any blocks above it first.\n\n3. **Stacking Onto a Block That is Not Clear or Not in Position:**\n   - *Issue*: Trying to stack a block onto a target block that has another block on it or is not in its goal position.\n   - *Avoidance*: Confirm that the target block is both clear and correctly placed before stacking.\n\n4. **Misordering Block Placement:**\n   - *Issue*: Stacking blocks without following the correct sequence, causing conflicts later.\n   - *Avoidance*: Always start from the bottom blocks and proceed upwards, ensuring the proper order.\n\n5. **Leaving Temporarily Moved Blocks in the Way:**\n   - *Issue*: Placing blocks that were unstacked onto locations that interfere with future moves.\n   - *Avoidance*: Put down temporarily moved blocks on the table in areas that won't obstruct other blocks.\n\n---\n\nBy carefully following these instructions and being mindful of the common mistakes, you can systematically manipulate the blocks to reach the desired goal configuration.\n----\n\nAn example solution (without reasoning steps) would look like:\n(unstack d c)\n(putdown d)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(unstack a b)\n(putdown a)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n\n*THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM, SOLVE IT*:\nInitial State:\n(handempty)\n(clear c)\n(clear b)\n(clear f)\n(on c e)\n(on e d)\n(on d a)\n(ontable a)\n(ontable b)\n(ontable f)\n\nGoal:\n(on a b)\n(on b c)\n(on c d)\n(on d e)\n(on e f)\nSolution:", "type": "text"}]}], "response": {"content": "**Solution:**\n\n```\n(unstack c e)\n(putdown c)\n(unstack e d)\n(stack e f)\n(unstack d a)\n(stack d e)\n(pickup c)\n(stack c d)\n(pickup b)\n(stack b c)\n(pickup a)\n(stack a b)\n```\n\n**Explanation of Actions:**\n\n1. **(unstack c e)**  \n   *Unstacks block\u202f**c** from block\u202f**e**.*  \n   -
