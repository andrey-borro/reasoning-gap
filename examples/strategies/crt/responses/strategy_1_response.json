This method applies regardless of the specific numbers, thematic context, or variable names involved.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Growth Pattern**\n\n- **Identify the Growth Factor**: Determine by what factor the quantity increases or decreases each time interval.\n  - For example, if something triples, the growth factor \\( k = 3 \\).\n  - If something halves, \\( k = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n- **Determine the Time Interval**: Find out how often this growth occurs (e.g., every 5 seconds).\n\n**Step 2: Define the Variables**\n\nLet\u2019s set up general variables to represent the quantities:\n\n- \\( A_0 \\): Initial amount (can be any non-zero value since it will cancel out later).\n- \\( A_{\\text{max}} \\): Maximum amount the quantity reaches.\n- \\( k \\): Growth factor per interval.\n- \\( t_1 \\): Time per growth interval.\n- \\( T \\): Total time taken to reach \\( A_{\\text{max}} \\).\n- \\( N_{\\text{total}} \\): Total number of growth intervals \\( \\left( N_{\\text{total}} = \\dfrac{T}{t_1} \\right) \\).\n- \\( n \\): The denominator of the fraction of the maximum amount \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\times A_{\\text{max}} \\right) \\).\n- \\( t \\): Time at which the quantity reaches \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\times A_{\\text{max}} \\).\n- \\( N \\): Number of intervals that have passed at time \\( t \\) \\( \\left( N = \\dfrac{t}{t_1} \\right) \\).\n\n**Step 3: Set Up the Exponential Growth Equation**\n\nThe amount after \\( N \\) intervals is:\n\n\\[\nA = A_0 \\times k^N\n\\]\n\nThe maximum amount after \\( N_{\\text{total}} \\) intervals is:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{max}} = A_0 \\times k^{N_{\\text{total}}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Relate the Target Amount to the Maximum Amount**\n\nSince we want to find when \\( A = \\frac{1}{n} \\times A_{\\text{max}} \\):\n\n\\[\nA_0 \\times k^N = \\frac{1}{n} \\times A_0 \\times k^{N_{\\text{total}}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the Equation**\n\nCancel \\( A_0 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nk^N = \\frac{1}{n} \\times k^{N_{\\text{total}}}\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( k^N \\) to isolate the exponential term:\n\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{1}{n} \\times k^{N_{\\text{total}} - N}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = k^{N_{\\text{total}} - N}\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Solve for the Number of Intervals**\n\nTake the logarithm of both sides to solve for \\( N \\):\n\n\\[\n\\log(n) = (N_{\\text{total}} - N) \\times \\log(k)\n\\]\n\nRearrange to solve for \\( N \\):\n\n\\[\nN = N_{\\text{total}} - \\frac{\\log(n)}{\\log(k)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 7: Find the Time Corresponding to \\( N \\) Intervals**\n\nSince each interval lasts \\( t_1 \\) units of time:\n\n\\[\nt = N \\times t_1 = \\left( N_{\\text{total}} - \\frac{\\log(n)}{\\log(k)} \\right) \\times t_1\n\\]\n\n**Step 8: Express Time Relative to Total Time**\n\nAlternatively, since \\( T = N_{\\text{total}} \\times t_1 \\):\n\n\\[\nt = T - \\left( \\frac{\\log(n)}{\\log(k)} \\times t_1 \\right)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Example Application**\n\nLet's apply this strategy to a similar problem:\n\n*\"A bacteria colony doubles in size every 3 hours. If it takes 15 hours for the colony to reach its maximum size, after how many hours was the colony at one-quarter of its maximum size?\"*\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Growth Factor and Time Interval**\n\n   - Growth factor \\( k = 2 \\) (since the colony doubles).\n   - Time per interval \\( t_1 = 3 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Number of Intervals**\n\n   - Total time \\( T = 15 \\) hours.\n   - \\( N_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{T}{t_1} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\) intervals.\n\n3. **Set the Target Fraction**\n\n   - We want \\( \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{4} \\), so \\( n = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Use the Equation to Solve for \\( N \\)**\n\n   \\[\n   N = N_{\\text{total}} - \\frac{\\log(n)}{\\log(k)} = 5 - \\frac{\\log(4)}{\\log(2)}\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( \\log(4)/\\log(2) = 2 \\) (because \\( 4 = 2^2 \\)), we have:\n\n   \\[\n   N = 5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Time \\( t \\)**\n\n   \\[\n   t = N \\times t_1 = 3 \\times 3\\ \\text{hours} = 9\\ \\text{hours}\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The colony was at one-quarter of its maximum size after 9 hours.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the General Method**\n\n- **Identify** the growth factor \\( k \\) and time per interval \\( t_1 \\).\n- **Determine** the total number of intervals \\( N_{\\text{total}} \\) using \\( T \\) and \\( t_1 \\).\n- **Set** the target fraction \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) of the maximum amount.\n- **Use** the equation \\( n = k^{N_{\\text{total}} - N} \\) and solve for \\( N \\).\n- **Calculate** the time \\( t = N \\times t_1 \\) or use \\( t = T - \\left( \\frac{\\log(n)}{\\log(k)} \\times t_1 \\right) \\).\n\nThis method can be applied to any similar problem involving exponential growth or decay where a quantity changes by a constant factor over equal time intervals.\n\n---\n\n**Tips for Solving Such Problems**\n\n- **Logarithms**: Familiarize yourself with logarithm properties, especially when dealing with exponential equations.\n- **Units Consistency**: Ensure that all time units are consistent throughout the problem.\n- **Fraction to Exponent Relation**: Recognize that \\( k^{\\log_k(n)} = n \\), which simplifies calculations.\n- **Check Your Work**: After finding \\( N \\) or \\( t \\), substitute back into the original equation to verify the solution.\n\nBy following these steps, you can approach and solve a wide range of problems that share this exponential growth pattern, even if they involve different variables or contexts.", "model": "o1-preview-2024-09-12", "output_tokens": 1597, "input_tokens": 125, "reasoning_tokens": 1728}}
